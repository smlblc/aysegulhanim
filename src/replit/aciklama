Family class{
  Create instance variables

    2 Integer -  totalUser, totalAmount

    2 String - familyName , familyPrimaryUser

  Create one method name is getTotalAmount

    Parameter is PhonePlan (next Class)

    This method will call the amount method from the PhonePlan class and multiply the result with amountOfUser
    result should be equal to totalAmount

     print  total Amount is : totalAmount
     family name is : familyName
     primary user is : familyPrimaryUser

  Use toString method while printing
}

PhonePlan class{

  Create instance variables

    1 String - planType

    1 Integer - priceForEach

  Create one method name is amount

    Parameter is 1 int (totalUser from Family class)

    if planType equal to eco and int is less or equal to 3
      priceForEach is 50

    if planType equal to eco and int is bigger then 3 and less or equal 5
      priceForEach is 45

    if planType equal to eco and int is bigger then 5
      priceForEach is 35

    if planType equal to premium and int is less or equal to 3
      priceForEach is 70

    if planType equal to premium and int is bigger then 3 and less or equal 5
      priceForEach is 60

    if planType equal to premium and int is bigger then 5
      priceForEach is 55

return the priceForEach

}

Main{

  Use Main method here

  Create 4 scanner variable

    Integer - amountOfUser

    String - familyName

    String - familyPrimaryUser

    String - planType

  Create one object for each class

  While defining the instance variables use scanner variables

  Print the object

  For example:

    Scanner s1 = new Scanner(System.in);

    String familyNameFromScanner = s1.nextLine();

     Family f1 = new Family();

     f1.familyName =familyNameFromScanner;

  Print example
     System.out.println(f1);
